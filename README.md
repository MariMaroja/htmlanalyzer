# HTML Analyzer

## Description
This project is a simple Java program that reads an HTML document from a given URL, validates its tag structure, and prints the deepest text node found in the document.

The program does not use external libraries or frameworks, only standard Java libraries (`java.io` and `java.net`), as required.
